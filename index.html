					Work on the HEX//LIMBICS series is going well, though the constant struggle between maintaining production quality and trying to actually release anything is, as always, delaying production. To be honest, I think some of the videos already released (01-05) are lackluster at best, but you ned to produce bad content to learn hoe to produce good content, I suppose.
				</p><p>
					The music for Subcycle 01-08 (HEX//WALK) is entirely written, but the corresponding videos still need to be shot and edited. I've got some big plans for cycles to follow, but I don't think I'll ever be able to hit my original goal of 1 cycle/month, which I had been aiming for initially. Other things in my life just get too much in the way. 
				</p><p>
					I've also started work on a live looping pedal built on top of a Raspberry Pi Model B. It's kind of regrettable that I bought a Pi a week before the Pi Model B+ was announced, but the upgrade specs aren't extremely significant, at least for prototyping. The one thing that I really want from the model B+ is the reduced noise on audio I/O, but beggars can't be choosers I suppose.
				</p><p>
					This website also exists now, which I'm proud of. It was mostly hacked together over the course of a few days, but I think it turned out all right. The aesthetic is somewhat pretentious-artistique, as the design was	originally conceived as a tounge-in-cheek thing making fun of overley modern and trendy bands, but i still think it looks good. The images are drawn mainly from 
					<a href="http://www.unsplash.com">unsplash.com</a>,
					a resource for free highres creative commons images. Don't tell anyone, it's one of my secret resources for pretending to be good at design. 
				</p><p>
					The site still has some optimization issues with windows-chrome, as the windows version of chrome thinks it has to rerender the entire frame on page scroll when the background of a section has both 
					background-position:fixed and background-size: cover declared. The initial load is also somewhat ugly in
					Firefox and Safari, as due to their lack of clip: polygon() support, I had to fall back on SVG file clipping, which loads after the pace.js loader has started loading. I suppose this is the price you pay for using nonstandard CSS features as part central to your aesthetic.

			<p>
				Is-Limbics is the the solo project of me, <a href="http://maxwell.huang-hobbs.com/">a university student</a> based out of Toronto. I have no idea what it will become in the future, nor what kind of genre of music this is going to focus on, so right now it's just the label for everything even remotely musical that I make.
			</p><p>
				I DO FOLK MUSIC AND ALSO SOME KIND OF ELECTRIC STUFF.
			</p><p>
				The current project of focus is the HEX//LIMBICS series, a set of 8-element themed cycles of music videos. The first Cycle (currently being released) is HEX//WALK, focusing on looped acoustic instrumentals with minor synth elements, paired with videos taken on walks around the city.
